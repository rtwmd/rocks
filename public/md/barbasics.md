## Tools Of The Trade

Here are a few of the items we use at Irresistibull Cocktails to make our drinks. You certainly don’t need all of these to enjoy our cocktails, but it never hurts to have the right tools. Besides, using the toys is part of the fun.

- [OXO Steel Double Jigger][1]
- [Martini Shaker][8]
- [Cocktail Strainer][9]
- [Citrus Press][6]
- [Bar Spoon][3]
- [Knife and Zester Set][4]
- [Muddler][5]
- [Wire Mesh Strainer][7]

The first four items are the basics that get used regularly. A citrus press is worth every penny.

## I Don't Have A Bottle Of That!

For many of the cocktails, the brand of spirit can be substituted and still maintain a similar flavor profile. There are a few exceptions.

### Vodka

For straight vodka, you can use pretty much any premium brand. Ketel One is our house vodka, but Grey Goose, Chopin, Belvedere, or other will suffice. Try not to use cheap vodkas as they don’t hold up as well in martinis. They are better suited in vodka tonics.

The flavored vodka brands can generally be exchanged. Flavored Ciroc vodkas have a sweeter taste than other brands. Keep that in mind when swapping.

### Gin

Gins are a bit trickier to exchange one for the other since their unique botanicals create their distinct flavors. Our personal tastes are for the gins that have citrus notes and are less ‘juniper-y’. Or as Ashley would say, they don’t smell and taste like a Christmas tree. The Botanist is our go-to house gin. Hendricks and St. George Botanivore are good swaps.

Some of the drinks use gins with an intentional flavor choice. For instance, Citadel Jardin D'Ete or Tanqueray Sevilla. If swapping out one of these gins, just be aware that the intended flavor may be missing in the final cocktail.

### Tequila

We prefer reposado (or anejo) tequilas in most of our drinks. The most common tequila is blanco. Reposados add a richer flavor which is why we prefer them. You can use a blanco as a replacement in most our tequila drinks, but the drink will lose some of its character. If you want to add a smokiness to your drink, try mezcal instead of the tequila. Or half mezcal and half tequila.

### Bourbon

Bourbons are a very personal preference spirit. Feel free to use your favorite bourbon in place of our suggested ingredient.

### Irish Whiskey

We recommend using the Irish whiskey in the recipe. They each have a distinct profile that make the drink what it is.

### Orange Liqueurs

Solerno is one of our favorites, but it is a challenge to find. You can easily use Cointreau or Triple Sec in its place. We prefer Cointreau over Triple Sec as it has a better flavor.

Grand Mariner and Gran Gala have a characteristic flavor that can’t easily be replaced by Cointreau or Triple Sec. You can still use these as replacements, but the final cocktail flavor will lose some of its depth.
